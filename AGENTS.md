# Repository Guidelines

This guide helps contributors build, test, and extend the My Reminder Flutter app consistently across iOS, Android, and desktop targets.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

Flutter sources live under `lib/`, split by role: `models/` holds data classes such as `subscription.dart`, `database/` wraps SQLite helpers, `services/` hosts local notification plumbing, `providers/` contains the app’s Provider state, and `views/` gathers screens and modals. Tests belong in `test/` alongside their corresponding feature directory. Platform shims (`android/`, `ios/`, `macos/`, `linux/`, `windows/`, `web/`) are generated by Flutter and should only hold integration tweaks. Shared build artifacts land in `build/`, while `prompts/` tracks product copy ideas; keep both out of manual edits unless necessary.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `flutter pub get` — install or update package dependencies defined in `pubspec.yaml`.
- `flutter run -d ios` / `flutter run -d android` — launch the app on a simulator or device for the specified platform.
- `flutter analyze` — run static analysis using `analysis_options.yaml`; gate every PR with a clean report.
- `flutter test` — execute unit and widget tests; pair with `flutter test --coverage` before feature completions to sanity-check coverage drift.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Follow Flutter defaults: 2-space indentation, trailing commas to trigger auto-formatting, and `dart format lib test` before committing. Name Dart files in `snake_case.dart`, widgets/state classes in `PascalCase`, private members with a leading underscore, and Provider instances with descriptive nouns (e.g., `subscriptionProvider`). Favor immutable models, keep database queries inside `DatabaseHelper`, and surface user copy via constants to simplify localization.

## Testing Guidelines

Create tests under `test/feature_name/` using the Flutter `test` package; suffix files with `_test.dart`. Mirror production namespaces so `lib/providers/subscription_provider.dart` pairs with `test/providers/subscription_provider_test.dart`. Mock notification scheduling where possible and assert Provider change notifications. Maintain or increase functional coverage, especially around billing calculations and reminder scheduling edge cases. Run `flutter test` locally before every push.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Git history favors concise, imperative messages such as `Add task and reminder screens`; mirror that format and prefix optional scope tags (`subscriptions:`, `notifications:`) when helpful. Reference GitHub issues or Trello cards in the body, describe platform impacts, and mention database migrations explicitly. For pull requests, include: a one-paragraph summary, testing evidence (`flutter analyze`, `flutter test` output), platform screenshots when UI changes occur, and notes about migrations or notification permission adjustments. Request reviews from at least one Flutter maintainer before merging.

## Security & Configuration Tips

Never commit signing keys, Firebase configs, or notification API secrets; use platform-specific secure stores and document setup steps in private notes. When editing `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` or `ios/Runner/Info.plist`, ensure required permissions match the reminder features and that user-facing rationale strings stay current.
